                    target="_blank">Aditya</a>. This game is developed in July/August 2023. In this game, you see 3 levels of Competition (Easy, Medium, Hard). If you choose any one the play button is display on the screen and you can click on button and play game. The game's theme is Totaly Dark and I also add Bg music and correct answer music to Increase user experience. Words are display on the screen according your level and it is an task for you that you complete those words in given time. After the end of the game, you see an result box, where you can track your typing speed in words per given time. Also you can see your target that you completed or not. At the end , to restart this game, i can't make any functionality.(The reason I described below). I make an button, who reload the page for restarting this game. I think that is enough details. Let's Play Game and Enjoy it. <br/>

<i><b>Note :- </b> This game is developed by me in July/August 2023. I started learning Web Development from You Tube in July and I learn HTML , CSS and JavaScript. When starting develope this game, I knew JavaScript as much as a chick sitting inside an egg knows the world outside the egg. So i make many mistakes. Currently I know frontend and I edit this game and make it responsive for all devices and remove some unwanted code and comments from it. But I dont edit game's working functionality. I edit only some lines or errors. I want the game to remain exactly as I created it, so I can track my progress. So I edit it accordingly. </i>

Material : All the used music are from web so you can use them. </br>

But you can't use this name to make your project or else.
